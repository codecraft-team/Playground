# ES2015 Modules in browser

ES modules in browser are under development, but for testing, first switch on the feature

- Edge -> about:flags -> "Experimental javascript feature"
- chrome: the dev version Canary is needed (Version 60): [download here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) then -> chrome:flags -> "Experimental Web Platform feture"

The samples shows simple implementation of modules without transpiling something first.

Further feature to be test (not yet done)

- more samples with import and export
- nomodule flag (for backwards compatibility)
- defer module for loading 
- async loading modules
- combine with http/2
